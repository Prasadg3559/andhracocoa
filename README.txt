AndhraCocoa — Drag‑and‑Drop Website
====================================

How to publish in the easiest way (Netlify Drop):

1) Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2) Drag the folder contents (index.html + images) onto the page.
3) Netlify will give you a public URL like https://something.netlify.app
4) To update later, drag‑and‑drop the new files again — your site updates instantly.
5) Optional: Add your custom domain in Netlify -> Domain settings and enable HTTPS.

To edit the site:
- Open index.html in any text editor (VS Code/Notepad).
- Change text, numbers, or section titles as you like.
- Replace images LOGO.jpeg / ADDRESS.jpeg with new versions (same file names).
- Save, then re‑upload to Netlify Drop to publish the changes.

Contact form (optional):
- Sign up at https://formspree.io/
- Create a form and copy your endpoint URL (looks like https://formspree.io/f/xxxxxx).
- In index.html, replace the 'action' attribute of the <form> with your endpoint.
